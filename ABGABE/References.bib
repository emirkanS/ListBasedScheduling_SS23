abstract = {Control architectures have evolved to be a main part of the power converter control systems with a wide variety of possibilities in terms of technology, performance, and cost. This chapter reviews the history of control architectures, highlighting the transition from analog to digital control, as well as the digital implementation workflow. The main available technologies are reviewed, including modern trends for simulation, optimization, and implementation of modern control systems.},

abstract = {From the Publisher:Synthesis and Optimization of Digital Circuits offers a modern, up-to-date look at computer-aided design (CAD) of very large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits. In particular, this book covers techniques for synthesis and optimization of digital circuits at the architectural and logic levels, i.e., the generation of performance-and/or area-optimal circuits representations from models in hardware description languages. The book provides a thorough explanation of synthesis and optimization algorithms accompanied by a sound mathematical formulation and a unified notation. The text covers the following topics: modern hardware description languages (e.g., VHDL, Verilog); architectural-level synthesis of data flow and control units, including algorithms for scheduling and resource binding; combinational logic optimization algorithms for two-level and multiple-level circuits; sequential logic optimization methods; and library binding techniques, including those applicable to FPGAs.},
